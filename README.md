## Why was this package created

There are two reasons I created this package.

1. There are no reusable views written from Elm-Ui
2. There are a lot of reusable views out there, all trying to reinvent the wheel,
    and all do it differently. This packages tries to keep the complexity at a minimum and all the widgets consistent with eachother.
