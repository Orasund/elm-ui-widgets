# Contributing to this repository

This file should give you a general direction where this repository is heading and how you can contribute.

## Roadmap

The idea is that version 4.0.0 should mark the feature-complete release of elm-ui-widgets. This essentially means that we can NOT allow having a major update for some small change. Issues marked as 4.0.0 should have an intermediate fix in 3.X.X. The idea would to let some version of 3.X.X. be feature-complete and to then go over the API one final time.

Development is quite slow. If you need something, the fasted way is to start a new issue and help out. Any help is welcome.

## How to contribute

Always start with an issue, PRs that are not related to issues will be instantly rejected. 

If you want to help out, just look through all the open issues and pick one you'd like to tackle.
